<p>My aim for this assessment is to create a drawing application. 
    Which is easily accessable and easy to use. 
    It should allow you to draw shapes and change colours by the click of a button.</p>
            
<h1> Sprint 1</h1>
<p> Within this Sprint I want to be able to draw a rectangle within a 
    defined area on a canvas (within a boundary).
