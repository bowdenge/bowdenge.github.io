<p>My aim for this assessment is to create a drawing application. 
    Which is easily accessable and easy to use. 
    It should allow you to draw shapes and change colours by the click of a button.</p>

<h1> Sprint 1</h1>
<p> Within this Sprint I want to be able to draw a rectangle within a 
    defined area on a canvas (within a boundary).

<h3>Testing Sprint 1</h3>
<p>This video is a test for checking my boundary check works.
    I clearly move the mouse around the screen to inspect where on the console
    it reads 'true' or 'false'. Testing all the edges and corners to ensure it extends 
    to all areas and won't be able to be broken.

<p>In this video you will be able to see me testing the dragging function.
    Checking that it obeys the boundary function and will only allow a rectangle 
    to be drawn if it is within the boundarys and the boundary check is 'true'.

<h1> Sprint 2</h1>
<p> Within this second Sprint I wish to be able to draw both rectangles and ellipses' within a boundary. Also being able to 
        utilise buttons to alter between my chosen shape to draw with.

<h3>Testing Sprint 2</h3>
<p>This video is a test for checking that I am able to draw a ellipse within the boundary and without faults.
    I click and drag within and outside the drawing canvas as well as dragging backwards to check that the 
    application has no faults with that as it did used to change the values to negative meaning I was unable to draw a ellipse backwards.
    However I have added code to fix that and it appears to be working.

<p>In this video you will be able to see me testing to check that the buttons work.
    I change the selection of my buttons again checking that the boundary still works for drawing both shapes.
    Then also checking that the buttons change colour when hovered above and also when selected so that the user
    is able to see what shape they are currently drawing with. All seems to work well.
